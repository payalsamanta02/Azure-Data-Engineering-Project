# Azure Data Engineering Project: Olympic Dataset Analysis

Olympic dataset analysis using various tools and technologies, including Azure Data Factory, Data Lake Gen 2, Synapse Analytics, and Azure Databricks.


## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing an Olympic dataset using various tools and technologies available on the Azure platform. The dataset contains information about athletes, coaches, teams, entries, and medals across different disciplines and countries. 

## Tools and Technologies
- Azure Data Factory: For data ingestion, transformation, and orchestration.
- Azure Data Lake Gen 2: As a storage solution for storing raw and processed data.
- Azure Synapse Analytics: For data warehousing, querying, and analytics.
- Azure Databricks: For advanced data processing, analytics, and machine learning.

## Project Structure
- **Data Ingestion:** Use Azure Data Factory to ingest data from various sources into Azure Data Lake Gen 2.
- **Data Preparation:** Utilize Azure Data Factory for data cleansing, transformation, and enrichment.
- **Data Storage:** Store the processed data in Azure Data Lake Gen 2 for further analysis.
- **Data Analysis:** Perform exploratory data analysis, aggregation, and visualization using Azure Synapse Analytics.
- **Advanced Analytics:** Utilize Azure Databricks for advanced analytics tasks such as machine learning, statistical analysis, and predictive modeling.

## Detailed Steps
1. **Data Ingestion:**
   - Set up connections to the data sources (e.g., CSV files, databases).
   - Create data ingestion pipelines in Azure Data Factory to extract data from the sources.
   - Schedule the pipelines to run at regular intervals for automatic data ingestion.

2. **Data Preparation:**
   - Cleanse the data to handle missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.
   - Transform the data as per the analysis requirements (e.g., aggregations, joins).
   - Enrich the data by combining it with additional information if necessary (e.g., country codes, athlete profiles).

3. **Data Storage:**
   - Define a storage hierarchy in Azure Data Lake Gen 2 to organize the raw and processed data.
   - Store the ingested and processed data in appropriate folders within the data lake.
   - Ensure data security and access control using Azure AD authentication and role-based access control (RBAC).

4. **Data Analysis:**
   - Create SQL scripts or Spark notebooks in Azure Synapse Analytics to perform data analysis.
   - Write SQL queries to aggregate, filter, and visualize the data to gain insights.
   - Generate reports and dashboards to present the findings to stakeholders.

5. **Advanced Analytics:**
   - Utilize Azure Databricks for more advanced analytics tasks such as machine learning and predictive modeling.
   - Train machine learning models to predict future outcomes or classify data based on patterns.
   - Evaluate the performance of the models and iterate on them as needed for improvement.

## Conclusion
By leveraging Azure Data Factory, Data Lake Gen 2, Synapse Analytics, and Databricks, this project enables comprehensive analysis of the Olympic dataset. From data ingestion to advanced analytics, the Azure platform provides a scalable and efficient solution for deriving valuable insights from large and complex datasets.
